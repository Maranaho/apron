# Apron take home CRUD webapp
##### Naho N'Guessan

Thanks for reviewing my work.
I made this [webapp](https://apron-naho.vercel.app/) to apply at Apron for a Frontend role.
You can use the branches to navigate my progress and get a sense of how I approached this test.
Here's a quick overview:

1. I started by organising an api to simulate a backend for managing users with functions that allow fetching, adding, editing, and soft-deleting users.
2. I implemented these CRUD operations with custom hooks that use React Queryâ€™s useMutation to add, edit, delete a user and update the user list asynchronously.
3. I persisted the data in localStorage, again to simulate a db.
4. Implemented testing with Playwright.
5. I then built up the ui a bit more, adding components and building the buttons and table.
6. I created the form to add and edit users.
7. I styled the form, all CSS is done with CSS Modules and I also set up tokens.
8. I implemented the sorting feature.
9. I wrote a few e2e tests with playwright.
